# count = 10

# until count == 0
#   puts count
#   count -= 1
# end

count = 1
# count from 1 to 10
until count > 10
  puts count
  count += 1
end

# * until loop iterates until the condition evaluates as true. We would like until to iterate until count is greater than 10. Use greater than so 10 is included in the output.
# to count up the count variable needs to be initialized as 1 and withint the loop the += reassignment operator should be used to increment the count variable
